This project contains all the programs in CSCi455 course. All the programs are programs for newbie but practice is the best teacher. CSCI 455 is a good course for someone who want to be a programmer. The programs contain JAVA and C++(lab12, lab13 and PA5). 

* *PA\** are the course assignments.
* *lab\** are the labs done in lab classes.

The instructions of each programs are included in each programs' file and there are the *brief* description of programs.
* lab1 A lab to introduce the Unix shell, and compiling and running java programs.
* lab2 A practice using simple console I/O. 
* lab3 A practice working with a class implementation, a test driver, and dealing with numeric computations.
* lab4 A practice programming with array lists by implementing a class, Nums, that encapsulates one (i.e., there's an ArrayList inside every Nums object) and that has a few methods to examine and manipulate it. 
* lab6 A symbolic debugger to use with Java programs. 
* lab9 A practice with exception handling.
* lab10 A practice trying out some of the Java and Java library features including Maps, sorting, and interfaces. 
* lab11 A practice working with stacks.
* lab12 A practice trying out C++ vectors. 
* lab13 A symbolic debugger to use with g++-compiled programs on Linux.
