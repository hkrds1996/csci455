Lab 3

Note: On-campus students can put their answers to the lab questions in this file, or in a text file created in another text editor, or use a piece of paper they can show to their lab TA.  DEN students will need to put their answers in this README, so they will get submitted.


Question 1.1:
      register.recordPurchase(4.35);
      register.receivePayment(5,0,0,0,0);
      System.out.print("Total: ");
      System.out.println(register.getTotal());
      int change = register.giveChange();
      System.out.println("Change:");
      System.out.println(String.valueOf(change));

Question 1.2:
error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to int
The return of function giveChange is double and I assgin returned value to an integer number, which will cause this error.

Question 2.1:
no

Question 3.1:
cp ex2/* ex3/

Question 4.1:
Error1 "CashReg cannot be applied to given types;register.receivePayment(payment);"
After modifing receivePayment, we got "CashRegTester4.java:24: error: incompatible types: double can
not be converted to Change"


public void receivePayment(Change change)
   {
      payment = change.totalValue()/100.0;
   }

public Change giveChange()
   {
      double change = payment - purchase/100.0;
      int dollars,quarters,dimes,nickels,pennies= 0;
      dollars = (int)change;
      quarters = (int)Math.round((change - dollars)*100)/25;      
      dimes = (int)Math.round((change - dollars - 0.25 * quarters) * 100)/10;
      nickels = (int)Math.round((change - dollars - 0.25 * quarters - 0.10 * dimes) * 100)/5;
      pennies = (int)Math.round((change - dollars - 0.25 * quarters - 0.10 * dimes - 0.05 * nickels) * 100 )/1;   
      purchase = 0;
      payment = 0;
      return (new Change(dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies));
   }
   }
