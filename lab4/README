Note: On-campus students can put their answers to the lab questions in this file, or use a piece of paper they can show to their lab TA.  DEN students will need to put their answers in this README, so they will get submitted.

Question 1.1:
If you test a bounch of code, you won't find out which parts have problem.

Question 2.1:
nums.in -17
test1.in 212
test2.in 2147483648

Question 3.1:
nums.in:
Values greater than 10: (17 17 21 18)
Values greater than -20: (3 -7 10 17 9 -17 17 21 18 7)
Values greater than -17: (3 -7 10 17 9 17 21 18 7)
Values greater than 21: ()

test1.in:
Values greater than 10: (23 34 45 23)
Values greater than -20: (23 34 45 23 -2 9 8)
Values greater than -17: (23 34 45 23 -2 9 8)
Values greater than 21: (23 34 45 23)

test2.in:
Values greater than 10: (2147483647 2147483647)
Values greater than -20: (2147483647 2147483647)
Values greater than -17: (2147483647 2147483647)
Values greater than 21: (2147483647 2147483647)

Question3.2:
Original list of nums: (-20 -17 21 10 9 11 -16 -19 -21 -18 20 22 11)
Values greater than 10: (21 11 20 22 11)
Values greater than -20: (-17 21 10 9 11 -16 -19 -18 20 22 11)
Values greater than -17: (21 10 9 11 -16 20 22 11)
Values greater than 21: (22)

Question 4.1
Special symbol
character

Question 4.2
(nums.valuesGT(threshold)).printVals();

Question 4.3
a instance of Nums

Question 4.4
Nums myNums = nums.valuesGT(threshold);
myNums.printVals();

Question 4.5
ArrayList needs more extra storage to store data.If we know how many numbers we want to storage, array is better.

Question 4.6
ArrayList can grow and shrink as we want.

Question 4.7
1 no. Because we can  read and print at the same time.
2 no. Because we just need to record the minimum number, an int variable is good enough.
3 no. Because we can read and print at the same time and use a local int variable to record the minimum number and print the minimum number later.
4 no. We can compare the numbers with threshhold when we read and print the values.
5 yes.We should use it because we need to compare our numbers with the threshold.
6 yes. Because we need to use the values later.
