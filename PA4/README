DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CLASS DESIGN AND ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES USED:
In my program, I have six classes.

View:
   WordFinder: main class responsible for interactive with user. Geting input from user and response to user.This class also sorts the possible words by 
           using "Collections.sort" with the Comparator class called "myComparator", then shows the user the possible words and their score.

Controller:
   ControllerField: this's the controller in my program. responsible for connecting user and models.

Models:
   AnagramDictionary: dictionary of all anagram sets. Recording the information of the dictionary.I used the second way to
                record dictionary's information.
                I used "HashMap<String, HashSet<String>>" to record anagram sets. The complexity of get a word's anagram
                sets is O(n).

   Rackï¼š corresponds to the idea of the rack in the problem. This Rack inculdes the methods that processes the rack of
        scabble tiles. I used "ArrayList<String>" to store all the possible words' anagrams.
      
   ScoreTable: a custom class responsible for counting score. I used "Map<String, Integer>" to record words and their scores.
           Besides, I used "static final int[]" to record 26 letters' scores.
      
   IllegalDictionaryException:  This class reports problems with the dictionary file.
